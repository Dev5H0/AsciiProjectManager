# Ascii_Project_Manager
A project designed to help with the management of ascii files. 

So far you can open files in an editor, create new files, and print out the contents of a file.

As of this moment, you will have to change the editor manually, which you can do by going into 'main', 'settings.xml' and pasting one of the paths from <editors> into <settings editor="INPUT PATH HERE">


Currently tested editors are Wordpad, Notepad, Notepad++ & Visual Studio Code, the default one being Notepad.
