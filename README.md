# Ascii_Project_Manager
A project designed to help with the management of ascii files. 

So far you can open files in an editor, create new files, and print out the contents of a file in the console.

If you want to use an editor that is not mentioned in the tested editors menu, you'll have to change it manually.
main - settings.xml - <settings editor="INPUT PATH HERE">


Currently tested editors are Wordpad, Notepad, Notepad++ & Visual Studio Code, the default one being Notepad.
